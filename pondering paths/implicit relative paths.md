# implicit relative paths 
=========================================================================
i have linked the terminal,and run the path,then used the directory / ...so for reltive path we should no use / as we took as directory so i have used it without / and run the path again

hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the / directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
