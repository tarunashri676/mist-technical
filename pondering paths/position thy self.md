# position thy self 
============================================================================
i linked the terminal and then used the logic that first we need to rum the current directory and file then we get a new directory we should move to .then we use cd and the new directoryand file 
,so that cd(change directory) works and then again i run the challenge and run as it is moved into it .

===============================================================================================

hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /var/log directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /var/log
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/var/log$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
